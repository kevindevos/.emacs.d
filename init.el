;; Notes
;; setq stands for set quoted, so (setq variable_name 4) is the same as (set 'variable_name 4)
;; we do variable_name to access the value of said variable (or function potentially)
;; we do 'variable_name to access only the variable's symbol itself
;; the p in stringp, boundp, comandp , etc... stands for predicate, a predicate has the purpose of either returning t or nil (boolean style)

;; QUOTING LAMBDAS ?
;; There is no need to quote a lambda expression because lambda is a macro that expands into (function (lambda ...)).
;; (function ...) is more or less equivalent to (quote ...) and that is equivalent to '... â€“ using function instead of quote just helps the byte compiler a little bit.


;; !!!!!!!!!!!!!
;; Refactoring in emacs projects
;; I now use helm-ag to find all instances of the function name (searches in all files, incl. subdirs, not just in open buffers), and
;; then I use C-c C-e to enter a buffer that lists all the matches and there I change the function name. When I am done I press 
;; C-c C-c (helm-ag--edit-commit) to store the changes to all the opened files.
